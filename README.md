# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Instructions

## Complete the following steps:

## 1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

## 2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

  * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

  * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

  * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.



## 3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.



## 4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

## 5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.


## 6. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown below:


## 7. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
